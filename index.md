### 1. Embedded Deep Learning based Semantic Segmentation using TensorFLow Lite
<p align="justify">
This work explores the task of traffic scene segmentation using convolution neural network. The trained models are passed through 4 compression techniques (without quantization, Float16, Dynamic range, Int8) using TensorFlow Lite. The compression allows the model to achieve the maximum reduction of up to 91 percent with reduced noise.<br>

### 2. Survey on Variational Scene Flow Estimation

<p align="justify">
The aim of the paper is to study various variational methods for scene flow estimation and classify them based on the camera setting and the energy formulation. The paper further focuses on to asses the optimization algorithms used in the literature and deduce a logical comparison in terms of deviation from the ground truth of different data sets. <br>

### 3. Behaviour based Control Strategy for Double Ackermann Steering Control of Autonomous Tandem Road Rollers
<p align="justify">
The projects explores the trajectory tracking application for road rollers during edge compaction task. The roller receives path information from the paver through a remote interface. The algorithm extracts the edge spline of the path and then is offset to create a trajectory for the rollers to maneuvre. The behaviour based control strategy allows the rollers to switch to crab steering mode of the "Edge Compaction mode is activated. <br>

### 4. Multi-Robot Formation Control using Graph Theory

<p align="justify">
The project is an attempt to achieve the decentralized multi-robot formation control with the help of graph theory. In particular, we have studied different characteristics of multi-robot systems and formation control strategies associated with them. The project consists of of three experiments involving the square formation control of four unicycle robots using decentralized coordination. <br>
